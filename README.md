## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**  
   The app is split into reusable React components (`App`, `PortfolioPage`, `ProfileCard`, `TemplateSelection`, etc.) for maintainability and scalability.

2. **State Management:**  
   Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage form data, selected skills, certifications, services, and preview state.

3. **Dynamic Data Structure:**  
   - **Skills:** Stored as an object grouped by category, with each skill's proficiency set by the user.
   - **Certifications/Services:** Stored as arrays, allowing multiple entries.

4. **Live Preview:**  
   The form data is passed to the `PortfolioPage` component for instant preview, reflecting all changes in real time.

5. **Styling:**  
   - Uses modern CSS for layout, colors, and effects.
   - Section titles have yellow underlines.
   - Skills, certifications, and services are displayed in visually distinct containers.

6. **API Integration:**  
   - Uses Axios for fetching and saving professionals and templates.
   - Data is stored in a local `db.json` via `json-server` for development.
